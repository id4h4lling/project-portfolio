# portfolio
This is my portfolio with a collection of my latest projects in frontend development. The portfolio will be updated weekly during the bootcamp with new projects and interesting articles.

# The project 
I've built a portfolio following a design also making sure it's responsive and accessibel. 
I've used Lighthouse, Wave and W3C's validators for HTML and CSS in this project to check for errors and issues with performance, accessibility and validation. I have also checked the page and it accessibility in Firefox and Edge.
