# portfolio
This is my portfolio with a collection of my latest projects in frontend development. The portfolio will be updated weekly during the bootcamp with new projects and interesting articles.

# The project 
I've built a portfolio following a design also making sure it's responsive and accessibel. 
I've used Lighthouse, Wave and W3C's validators for HTML and CSS in this project to check for errors and issues with performance, accessibility and validation. I have also checked the page and it accessibility in Firefox and Edge. The code was validating with some errors that will be fixed as soon as i have more time: 

-links tags are not correct and a div on line 73 that's not closed, haven't figured them out? The brief said that the links should rap the whole section with pictures and all, right?
- Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
- Links do not have a discernible name
- Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order.
